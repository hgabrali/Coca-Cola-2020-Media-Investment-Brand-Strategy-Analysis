### 1. Executive Summary: Market Consolidation & Dominance

The 2020 fiscal year analysis reveals a highly consolidated market structure where the **"Category Captain"** (Market Leader) dictates the pacing of media investment. The competitive landscape is characterized by a **"Fortress Defense"** strategy by the leader, utilizing massive budget volume to drown out competitor noise, while challenger brands adopt niche **"Flanker Strategies"** to capture specific audience segments.

---

### 2. Strategic Insights by Visualization

#### 📊 A. Share of Spend (SOS) Analysis
> **Objective:** To determine the financial hierarchy and **"Share of Wallet"** within the category.

<img width="1207" height="558" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e415ea8f-6b31-43db-90e5-9c3d8c86e0b7" />

* **The "Goliath" Effect:** Coca-Cola commands an overwhelming **Share of Spend (SOS)** compared to the aggregate of its competitors. This level of spending indicates a strategy focused on **Mental Availability** (keeping the brand top-of-mind) rather than just tactical sales activation.
* **The Challenger Gap:** Brands like Pepsi and Fanta occupy the **"Challenger"** tier. Their spending is significant but strategically capped, likely focusing on **Flighting Strategies** (intermittent bursts of advertising) rather than the **"Always-On"** presence maintained by the leader.
* **Local vs. Global:** Local competitors (e.g., Torku, Didi, Uludağ) operate with significantly leaner budgets, necessitating a **High-Efficiency Strategy** where every Turkish Lira (TL) must yield maximum reach.

#### 🎨 B. Media Mix & Channel Allocation Strategy
> **Objective:** To decode the tactical "Where" and "How" of competitor investments.

<img width="894" height="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb92a163-bb10-40fb-a8c6-63c19d294ac2"/> 

* **Linear TV Dependency:** The 100% Stacked Bar visualization confirms that the Turkish beverage market is historically **TV-Centric**. Across almost all top 10 brands, Television accounts for the lion's share (>85%) of the budget. This validates the industry heuristic that TV is the primary driver for **Mass Reach** in FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods).
* **Divergent Strategies:**
    * **The Leader's Mix:** Coca-Cola can afford a diversified mix (TV + Outdoor + Cinema), utilizing **360-Degree Communication** to surround the consumer.
    * **The Niche Mix:** Smaller competitors (e.g., Red Bull or Local Teas) show a distinct deviation. They may over-index in specific channels or specific TV genres (e.g., **Sponsorships** vs. **Standard Spots**) to bypass the high cost of **Prime Time** clutter.

#### 📈 C. Efficiency Analysis: Share of Spend (SOS) vs. Share of Voice (SOV)
> **Objective:** To measure **"Buying Efficiency"** and **Return on Investment (ROI)** potential.


<img width="1239" height="589" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a98c73e-f400-44f1-aa00-857d78f97a6d" />

* **The Efficiency Gap:** This dual-axis chart is the most critical strategic tool.
* **High Efficiency (The "Smart Buyer"):** If a brand's Red Line (**GRP - Gross Rating Points**) is significantly higher relative to its Gray Bar (**Cost**), that brand has achieved a low **Cost Per Point (CPP)**. This suggests superior media buying negotiations or a smarter selection of **Dayparts** (e.g., utilizing **Day Time** vs. **Prime Time**).
* **Diminishing Returns:** For the market leader, the curve may flatten. Spending an extra 1 Million TL yields fewer incremental GRPs due to **Audience Saturation** and **Frequency Capping** limits.
* **Excess Share of Voice (ESOV):** Brands whose **SOV (Share of Voice)** exceeds their **SOS (Share of Spend)** are growing their market share. The analysis suggests that challenger brands are aggressively trying to achieve positive ESOV to steal market share from the leader during the pandemic volatility.

### 3. Key Takeaways for Stakeholders

1.  **Inflation Proofing:** The correlation between high spend and high GRP remains strong, but **Media Inflation** (Cost per Second increase) poses a risk for smaller players. They cannot compete on volume; they must compete on creativity and segmentation.
2.  **Resilience in Crisis:** Despite the Q2 Lockdown, the sustained high spending by top players proves that brand building in this category is viewed as a **Long-Term Investment**, not a variable cost to be cut at the first sign of trouble.
3.  **Optimization Opportunity:** There is a clear arbitrage opportunity to shift budgets from saturated **Prime Time** TV slots to under-utilized, high-affinity channels (like **Thematic TV** channels) to lower the category-wide CPP.

# 🔬 4. Advanced Strategic Deep Dive (New Dimensions)

Going beyond basic metrics, this section uncovers the tactical nuances of the media strategy using four advanced dimensions.

### A. Creative Execution Strategy (Format Analysis)

<img width="1176" height="549" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6442dabd-95b4-4b35-9bb5-2d18c8388d4a" />


* **Visualization:** *Budget Allocation by Ad Format*
* **Insight:** While **Standard Spots** consume the majority of the budget, significant investments in **Sponsorships** and **Overlays (Bant Reklam)** indicate a strategy to bypass ad clutter. These premium formats suggest a focus on **Brand Integration** rather than just interruption.

### B. Vendor Concentration (Pareto Analysis)

<img width="1192" height="557" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6021bf00-c06f-4b94-9f47-aa8831927a46" />

* **Visualization:** *Top 10 Media Partners*
* **Insight:** The spending is highly concentrated within top-tier TV channels (e.g., FOX, TV8, ATV). This consolidation implies strong **Upfront Agreements** and volume-based deal structures, giving the brand significant bargaining power over vendors.

### C. Duration Strategy (Storytelling vs. Tactical)

<img width="1168" height="540" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460011c4-7ea3-4d43-8f65-aa5ba35afe31" />

* **Visualization:** *Distribution of Spending by Duration*
* **Insight:** The histogram reveals a bimodal distribution. A peak at **45-60 seconds** indicates "Brand Building" / Storytelling campaigns, while peaks at **10-15 seconds** reflect "Frequency Builder" / Tactical reminder spots aimed at driving mental availability efficiently.

### D. Category Dynamics (Subsector Seasonality)

<img width="1407" height="652" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe23233a-fa6d-4c93-bf3e-2dbcf44e4066" />

* **Visualization:** *Monthly Spending Trends by Subsector*
* **Insight:** **Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSD)** and **Ice Tea** show a clear correlation with temperature (Summer Peak), whereas **Water** maintains a more baseline presence. This divergence necessitates category-specific "Flighting Models" (Media Scheduling) rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.



# 🚀 Strategic Deep-Dive: Advanced Media Analytics

## From Descriptive Data to Prescriptive Intelligence

This section details the advanced mathematical models applied to the 2020 media dataset to uncover hidden efficiencies and optimize future budget allocation.

---

### 📉 1. Diminishing Returns Analysis (Saturation Modeling)
> **Objective:** To identify the "Optimal Weekly Budget Cap" where marginal ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) begins to decline.

<img width="982" height="544" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1a06f6-8d96-4072-b4ae-9d685e8cbaa3" />


* **Methodology:** Applied **Logarithmic Regression** ($y = a + b \ln(x)$) to map Weekly Spend vs. Realized GRP.
* **Key Insight:** The curve clearly identifies a **Saturation Point**. Spending beyond this threshold yields diminishing incremental reach.
* **Actionable Recommendation:** Implement a **"Weekly Cap"** on linear TV spending. Excess budget should be reallocated to under-saturated channels (e.g., Digital or Outdoor) or saved for high-season weeks to maximize the **Marginal Utility** of every Turkish Lira.

---

### 🧠 2. Adstock Modeling (Brand Memory Decay)
> **Objective:** To measure the **"Carryover Effect"**—how long an ad continues to influence a consumer after it airs.

<img width="1175" height="547" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86bffb69-ed2a-4e11-9c79-c9067ba6f775" />


* **Methodology:** Modeled **Brand Pressure** using a geometric decay function on raw GRP data. The purple line represents the "Accumulated Stock" of brand visibility.
* **Key Insight:** The "Sawtooth" pattern validates the **Half-Life** of the campaign. The brand successfully builds momentum that sustains "Mental Availability" even during "dark" (non-active) weeks.
* **Actionable Recommendation:** Validate the current **"Flighting Strategy"** (Pulse Advertising). The Adstock decay rate suggests the brand can afford gaps of 1-2 weeks without losing significant share of mind, allowing for budget conservation.

---

### 💼 3. Channel Portfolio Matrix (BCG Efficiency Analysis)
> **Objective:** To classify media vendors based on **Cost Efficiency (CPP)** vs. **Volume Scalability (GRP)**.

<img width="890" height="564" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ade1147-6ae8-4de7-8737-c0b4b4de2eb3" />

* **Methodology:** A bi-variate scatter plot dividing vendors into four strategic quadrants.
    * **X-Axis:** Cost Per Point (Lower is Better).
    * **Y-Axis:** Total GRP Volume (Higher is Better).
* **Key Insight:**
    * **Cash Cows (Top-Left):** High Volume / Low Cost. These channels (e.g., ATV, FOX) are the backbone of the campaign.
    * **Money Pits (Bottom-Right):** Low Volume / High Cost. These vendors are dragging down the overall ROI.
* **Actionable Recommendation:** Conduct a **"Portfolio Pruning"**. Eliminate vendors in the "Money Pit" quadrant and reinvest savings into "Hidden Gems" (Low Cost / Moderate Volume) to lower the weighted average CPP of the campaign.

---

### 💸 4. Media Inflation Tracker (Cost Dynamics)
> **Objective:** To track the temporal evolution of inventory pricing (Cost Per Second).

<img width="1206" height="464" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d19e4560-e902-4b8d-96b2-00ec490945e4" />

* **Methodology:** Calculated the weekly **Cost Per Second (CPS)** index to isolate price fluctuations from volume changes.
* **Key Insight:** The trend reveals significant volatility in pricing, likely driven by post-lockdown demand surges or seasonal inventory scarcity (Q4).
* **Actionable Recommendation:** The observed volatility necessitates **"Upfront Annual Commitments"** rather than relying on the spot market. Locking in rates early would hedge against the inflation spikes observed in the latter half of the year.

# 🔬 Advanced Strategic Deep Dive: Beyond the Basics
## Tactical Deployment & Media Buying Architectures (2020)


### 1. Executive Overview of Tactical Decisions
While the primary analysis focused on volume and efficiency, this "Deep Dive" module applies specific segmentation algorithms to uncover the **tactical nuances** of the media strategy. We analyze the quality of the exposure, the negotiation leverage with vendors, and the narrative structure of the campaigns.

---

### 2. Analytical Dimensions & Findings

#### 🎨 A. Creative Execution Strategy (Ad Format Analysis)
> **Objective:** To evaluate the quality of exposure beyond simple Gross Rating Points (GRP).

* **The Findings:** While **Standard Spots** consume the majority of the budget (base load), significant investments in **Sponsorships** and **Overlays (Lower Thirds)** are observed.
* **Strategic Implication:** The brand is actively fighting **"Ad Clutter"** (the overcrowding of ads). By investing in sponsorships, they achieve **"Content Integration"**, ensuring visibility even when viewers skip standard commercial breaks. This suggests a shift from "Interruption Marketing" to "Integration Marketing."

#### 🏢 B. Vendor Concentration & Trading Strategy
> **Objective:** To assess the "Buying Power" and risk distribution among media partners.

* **The Findings:** The analysis reveals a high **Concentration Ratio**, adhering strictly to the **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**. Approximately 80% of the budget is allocated to the top 20% of vendors (Sales Houses like ATV, FOX, TV8).
* **Strategic Implication:**
    * **Pros:** High consolidation yields massive **"Negotiation Leverage"**, driving down the Cost Per Point (CPP) through volume-based deal structures (Upfront Agreements).
    * **Cons:** High dependency on a few networks risks **"Audience Saturation"** (hitting the same people repeatedly) and limits unique reach extension.

#### ⏱️ C. Duration Strategy (Storytelling vs. Tactical)
> **Objective:** To determine the balance between "Brand Building" (Long-term) and "Sales Activation" (Short-term).

* **The Findings:** The duration histogram exhibits a **"Bimodal Distribution"** (two distinct peaks):
    1.  **Short Form (10-15 seconds):** Focused on **"Frequency Building"** and tactical reminders (Call-to-Action).
    2.  **Long Form (45+ seconds):** Focused on **"Emotional Storytelling"** and Brand Equity construction.
* **Strategic Implication:** The brand employs a **"Hybrid Narrative Architecture."** They use long copies to establish the emotional hook and short copies to reinforce **"Mental Availability"** efficiently throughout the week.

#### 🌡️ D. Category Dynamics & Macro-Seasonality
> **Objective:** To correlate spending patterns with consumption occasions and environmental factors.

* **The Findings:**
    * **Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSD) & Water:** Show a strong **Positive Correlation** with seasonal temperature changes, peaking in Q3 (Summer).
    * **Tea & Coffee:** Exhibit a more **Inelastic Demand** curve or inverse seasonality (Winter peaks).
* **Strategic Implication:** The budget allocation follows a rigorous **"Flighting Pattern"** (bursts of activity followed by silence) rather than a "Continuous" strategy. This ensures that **Share of Voice (SOV)** is maximized precisely when the consumer thirst index is highest.
