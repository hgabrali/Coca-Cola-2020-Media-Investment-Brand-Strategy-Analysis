### 1. Executive Summary: Market Consolidation & Dominance

The 2020 fiscal year analysis reveals a highly consolidated market structure where the **"Category Captain"** (Market Leader) dictates the pacing of media investment. The competitive landscape is characterized by a **"Fortress Defense"** strategy by the leader, utilizing massive budget volume to drown out competitor noise, while challenger brands adopt niche **"Flanker Strategies"** to capture specific audience segments.

### 2. Strategic Insights by Visualization

#### 📊 A. Share of Spend (SOS) Analysis
> **Objective:** To determine the financial hierarchy and **"Share of Wallet"** within the category.

* **The "Goliath" Effect:** Coca-Cola commands an overwhelming **Share of Spend (SOS)** compared to the aggregate of its competitors. This level of spending indicates a strategy focused on **Mental Availability** (keeping the brand top-of-mind) rather than just tactical sales activation.
* **The Challenger Gap:** Brands like Pepsi and Fanta occupy the **"Challenger"** tier. Their spending is significant but strategically capped, likely focusing on **Flighting Strategies** (intermittent bursts of advertising) rather than the **"Always-On"** presence maintained by the leader.
* **Local vs. Global:** Local competitors (e.g., Torku, Didi, Uludağ) operate with significantly leaner budgets, necessitating a **High-Efficiency Strategy** where every Turkish Lira (TL) must yield maximum reach.

#### 🎨 B. Media Mix & Channel Allocation Strategy
> **Objective:** To decode the tactical "Where" and "How" of competitor investments.

* **Linear TV Dependency:** The 100% Stacked Bar visualization confirms that the Turkish beverage market is historically **TV-Centric**. Across almost all top 10 brands, Television accounts for the lion's share (>85%) of the budget. This validates the industry heuristic that TV is the primary driver for **Mass Reach** in FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods).
* **Divergent Strategies:**
    * **The Leader's Mix:** Coca-Cola can afford a diversified mix (TV + Outdoor + Cinema), utilizing **360-Degree Communication** to surround the consumer.
    * **The Niche Mix:** Smaller competitors (e.g., Red Bull or Local Teas) show a distinct deviation. They may over-index in specific channels or specific TV genres (e.g., **Sponsorships** vs. **Standard Spots**) to bypass the high cost of **Prime Time** clutter.

#### 📈 C. Efficiency Analysis: Share of Spend (SOS) vs. Share of Voice (SOV)
> **Objective:** To measure **"Buying Efficiency"** and **Return on Investment (ROI)** potential.


<img width="1239" height="589" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a98c73e-f400-44f1-aa00-857d78f97a6d" />

* **The Efficiency Gap:** This dual-axis chart is the most critical strategic tool.
* **High Efficiency (The "Smart Buyer"):** If a brand's Red Line (**GRP - Gross Rating Points**) is significantly higher relative to its Gray Bar (**Cost**), that brand has achieved a low **Cost Per Point (CPP)**. This suggests superior media buying negotiations or a smarter selection of **Dayparts** (e.g., utilizing **Day Time** vs. **Prime Time**).
* **Diminishing Returns:** For the market leader, the curve may flatten. Spending an extra 1 Million TL yields fewer incremental GRPs due to **Audience Saturation** and **Frequency Capping** limits.
* **Excess Share of Voice (ESOV):** Brands whose **SOV (Share of Voice)** exceeds their **SOS (Share of Spend)** are growing their market share. The analysis suggests that challenger brands are aggressively trying to achieve positive ESOV to steal market share from the leader during the pandemic volatility.

### 3. Key Takeaways for Stakeholders

1.  **Inflation Proofing:** The correlation between high spend and high GRP remains strong, but **Media Inflation** (Cost per Second increase) poses a risk for smaller players. They cannot compete on volume; they must compete on creativity and segmentation.
2.  **Resilience in Crisis:** Despite the Q2 Lockdown, the sustained high spending by top players proves that brand building in this category is viewed as a **Long-Term Investment**, not a variable cost to be cut at the first sign of trouble.
3.  **Optimization Opportunity:** There is a clear arbitrage opportunity to shift budgets from saturated **Prime Time** TV slots to under-utilized, high-affinity channels (like **Thematic TV** channels) to lower the category-wide CPP.

# 🔬 4. Advanced Strategic Deep Dive (New Dimensions)

Going beyond basic metrics, this section uncovers the tactical nuances of the media strategy using four advanced dimensions.

### A. Creative Execution Strategy (Format Analysis)

<img width="1176" height="549" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6442dabd-95b4-4b35-9bb5-2d18c8388d4a" />


* **Visualization:** *Budget Allocation by Ad Format*
* **Insight:** While **Standard Spots** consume the majority of the budget, significant investments in **Sponsorships** and **Overlays (Bant Reklam)** indicate a strategy to bypass ad clutter. These premium formats suggest a focus on **Brand Integration** rather than just interruption.

### B. Vendor Concentration (Pareto Analysis)

<img width="1192" height="557" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6021bf00-c06f-4b94-9f47-aa8831927a46" />

* **Visualization:** *Top 10 Media Partners*
* **Insight:** The spending is highly concentrated within top-tier TV channels (e.g., FOX, TV8, ATV). This consolidation implies strong **Upfront Agreements** and volume-based deal structures, giving the brand significant bargaining power over vendors.

### C. Duration Strategy (Storytelling vs. Tactical)

<img width="1168" height="540" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460011c4-7ea3-4d43-8f65-aa5ba35afe31" />

* **Visualization:** *Distribution of Spending by Duration*
* **Insight:** The histogram reveals a bimodal distribution. A peak at **45-60 seconds** indicates "Brand Building" / Storytelling campaigns, while peaks at **10-15 seconds** reflect "Frequency Builder" / Tactical reminder spots aimed at driving mental availability efficiently.

### D. Category Dynamics (Subsector Seasonality)

<img width="1407" height="652" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe23233a-fa6d-4c93-bf3e-2dbcf44e4066" />

* **Visualization:** *Monthly Spending Trends by Subsector*
* **Insight:** **Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSD)** and **Ice Tea** show a clear correlation with temperature (Summer Peak), whereas **Water** maintains a more baseline presence. This divergence necessitates category-specific "Flighting Models" (Media Scheduling) rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
