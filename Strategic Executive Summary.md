# 📊 1. Strategic Executive Summary (Key Insights)

The analysis of the dataset yields four critical conclusions regarding the 2020 media landscape:

* **Dominance of TV (Overwhelming Precedence):** Out of a total budget of **162.37 Million TL**, **91.8%** was allocated to Television. This indicates that brands selected TV as a "Safe Haven" during the period of uncertainty.
* **Efficiency Champion:** Interestingly, despite commanding the highest expenditure, TV offered the **lowest Cost Per Point (CPP)**. While the absolute cost appears high, it remains the most cost-effective medium relative to the audience reach it delivers.
* **Crisis Reflex (V-Shaped Recovery):** A sharp decline in spending is observed during the "Lockdown" period between March and May. However, budgets returned to normal levels in June, driven by a **"Revenge Spending"** strategy.
* **Market Leader:** In terms of total visibility (**Share of Voice**), **COCA-COLA** leads the market with **25.5%**. It has established a clear dominance in share of voice against its competitors.

* **Visualization:** Refer to the chart titled *Media Mix Optimization*.
* **Interpretation:** Budgets for Out-of-Home (OOH) and Cinema remained at marginal levels due to the pandemic. As Digital Media was not included in this specific dataset, Television alone dominated the media mix.

### B. Crisis Resilience

* **Visualization:** Refer to the chart titled *Crisis Resilience* containing the red shaded region.
* **Interpretation:** The red shaded area represents the full lockdown period (March–June). The graph hits rock bottom during this interval. Brands implemented a **"Recessionary Marketing"** (Budget Contraction) strategy rather than a "Share of Voice Maintenance" strategy.

### C. Cost Efficiency (CPP)

* **Visualization:** Refer to the trend line chart titled *Strategic Forecast*.
* **Interpretation:** The orange dashed line illustrates the trajectory of Q1 2021 spending if current trends persist. Due to high spending at the end of the year (Q4), the model predicts an **upward opening** for the beginning of 2021.
